  "content": "<p>React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have since become a staple in modern React development.</p><h2>Why Use Hooks?</h2><p>Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community.</p><h2>Common Hooks</h2><ul><li><strong>useState</strong>: Allows you to add state to functional components.</li><li><strong>useEffect</strong>: Lets you perform side effects in function components.</li><li><strong>useContext</strong>: Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.</li></ul><h2>Example: useState</h2><pre><code>import React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n</code></pre><p>In this example, <code>useState</code> initializes the state variable <code>count</code> to <code>0</code> and provides a function <code>setCount</code> to update it. The <code>useState</code> Hook returns a pair, the current state value and a function that lets you update it.</p><p>React Hooks have revolutionized the way we write React components, making code more readable and easier to maintain. By embracing Hooks, you can leverage functional programming principles and enhance your development workflow.</p>",
